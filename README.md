# RIAA Preamp (MM)

![Colorful PCB layout](https://kjeller.github.io/docs/mm_riaa_preamp/img/all_layer_output.png)

* Electrical schematic based on (Elliot's design)[https://sound-au.com/project06.htm]

* The PCB layout is based on my friend's power supply layout - Hi David :)

Note: It has been tested both with +/-15 and +/-9V supply. 15V fed through the regulators and 2*9V feed from batteries, skipping the power supply.
